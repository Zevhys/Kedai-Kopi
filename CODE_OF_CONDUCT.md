## TL;DR

Be respectful. Be kind. Don't be a jerk. That's it.

## The Long Version

This project is open to everyone—no matter your experience level, background, or who you are. All we ask is that you:

- **Respect others.** Treat people with kindness, even when you disagree.
- **Keep it constructive.** Criticism is fine, but make it helpful—not mean.
- **No harassment.** Seriously. Bullying, trolling, insults, or anything that makes someone feel unwelcome won't be tolerated.
- **Ask questions.** If you're unsure about something, just ask. There are no dumb questions here.
